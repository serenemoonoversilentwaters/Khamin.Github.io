                <p>I'm Khamin, a 15-year-old aspiring entrepreneur. I attend Ithaca High School in Ithaca, New York, where I regularly participate in clubs such as Debate, Science Olympiad, and Technology Student Association. Due to my involvement in these clubs, I'm well equipped with both STEM and soft-skills. Honestly, I'm quite ambitious, as I hope to someday use these skills of mine to revolutionize the way people go about their daily life and communication, perhaps by being the first to introduce true Virtual Reality tech. <br><br> I have a multitude of passions, but my biggest three would be trading on the stock market, programming, with an interest in Artificial Neural Networks, and studying strategical maneuvers related to ancient warfare. I spend quite some time every few days checking up on the value of my shares, along with reading about companies and the latest developments to determine what I want to consider buying. My interest in Artificial Neural Netwoks, along with my interest in multilevel logic has gotten me interested in developing a self-evolving antivirus, which you can find more about
